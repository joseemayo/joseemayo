- 👋 Hi, I’m @joseemayo
- I am currently a master's student at Texas State University studying Molecular Immunology with a focus in Bioinformatics.
- 👀 I’m interested in prallel processing and data science: sepcificially data analysis/visualization and bioinformatics.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to optimize my data analysis, data visualization and bioinformatic techniques. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any innovative projects that optimize previously used tools or focuses on solving previously unrecognized problems by either accelerating or simplifing analysis pipelines.
